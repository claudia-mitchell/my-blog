        <h2>What went well in the design process? / What did you feel? / What factors contributed to it? / Did you
            accomplish your Sprint goal? Why/Why not?</h2>

        <p>Surprisingly, my interview results turned out quite differently than expected. I entered the process with strong assumptions about the kinds of responses I’d receive, but I was caught off guard. The feedback I gathered contradicted many of my initial expectations, which ultimately shifted the direction of my project.
            <br><br>
            I had assumed that students would express a need for something like a food bank or a more accessible emergency fund. However, none of the participants were particularly interested in receiving external assistance. Instead, they opened up about their financial struggles, focusing more on the confusion around paying bills and navigating systems such as StudyLink. Rather than needing urgent help, they shared a common concern about managing and organising their finances more effectively.</p>

        <h2>What didn’t go well in the design process? / What did you feel? / What factors contributed to it?</h2>

        <p>At first, having all my assumptions challenged left me feeling disoriented, especially with limited time before the WIP presentation. I had conducted the interviews on Wednesday, with the slides due that same night, so needing to pivot my entire direction under pressure was definitely stressful. In the end, though, the shift turned out to be a positive one. Simon responded well to the new approach I took, which reassured me that unexpected changes like this are a normal part of the UX research process.</p>

        <h2>What can be improved? / What lessons have you learned?</h2>

        <p>My solution is still a work in progress. It came together at the last minute due to time constraints, but after receiving feedback from the WIP discussion, I now have a clearer sense of the types of field reviews and apps I should explore to strengthen my idea. I’m also revisiting my target audience and developing user journeys that align with my updated problem statement.</p>

        <h2>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h2>

        <p>I'm continuing to refine my solution and may conduct additional secondary research to strengthen my concept and identify any gaps I might have missed. From there, I'll begin creating a low-fidelity mockup and aim to start user testing with a few students.</p>
