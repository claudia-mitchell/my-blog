        <h2>What went well in the design process? / What did you feel? / What factors contributed to it? / Did you
            accomplish your Sprint goal? Why/Why not?</h2>

        <p>This week, I’m still completing my sprint goals, as I didn’t begin daily sprints as originally planned. I intend to implement them starting next week to better structure my time, manage tasks more efficiently, and ensure I meet my weekly objectives consistently.
            <br>
            Research is typically a challenging area for me, as I often struggle to identify reliable sources or know where to start. However, this week’s topic was widely covered across New Zealand media, making the process smoother. Listening to real student experiences shared through various outlets provided valuable insight and made the research feel more grounded and accessible.</p>

        <h2>What didn’t go well in the design process? / What did you feel? / What factors contributed to it?</h2>

        <p>A major hurdle for me was finalising my topic and identifying a specific problem affecting Aucklanders. I found this part of the brief particularly confusing at first, and I struggled to grasp how broad or narrow the issue should be. During the initial days, I felt unsure about where to begin. However, as the week progressed and we engaged in class activities sharing our ideas, my confidence grew. Simon’s feedback—that my chosen problem was clearly defined and my target audience was well narrowed—was especially encouraging and validated the direction I’m heading in.</p>

        <h2>What can be improved? / What lessons have you learned?</h2>

        <p>Digging further into my target audience. I've narrowed it down to a group of people but haven’t dug further into individuals. What I mean by this is crafting user personas and assessing their unique problems. Obviously, not everyone is going to have the same situations, problems, and awareness—so I have an opportunity to refine those I want to target specifically.</p>

        <h2>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h2>

        <p>Setting up a daily sprint plan to better manage the tasks I'll be starting next week. Although my weekly sprint plan maps out my daily tasks and what I should typically be aiming to complete, I might not have always completed the tasks the day before and need to add them to the next day. </p>
